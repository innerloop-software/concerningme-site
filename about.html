               <p><h3>One of the primary <b>goals of Concerning Me</b> is to provide an inclusive, safe, and effective platform for people to discuss their concerns with others.  Why would we spend time, energy, and money doing this?  Because we feel it's important to do something to make the world a better place, even if it's just by improving how people talk to each on the internet.</h3></p>

				<p>Discussions are plenty on the internet but most of them are uncivilized and degrade into negative posts which derail constructive discourse.  This is why we've based our site on a leading edge discussion platform called <a href="http://www.discourse.org" target="_blank">Discourse.</a>  Discourse is a 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.  It's a game changer when it comes to on-line discussion software.  You can read all about it <a href="http://www.discourse.org/faq/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<p>We have lots of features in the works that will help you connect with the issues that concern you and help you connect to people that will help you to address them.  Stay tuned!</p></p>

                     <p>Around the fall of 2014, Rob and Joel got together in order to collaborate on a project as yet
					 undetermined.  They had enjoyed working together in the past at Imaginet Resources in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  Both prairie boys had a desire to leverage their skills and experience in technology
					 in order to make a positive difference in the world.  Out of those early discussions came the
					 seed that would eventually grow into ConcerningMe.com.</p>
